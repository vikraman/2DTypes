\section{The Universe of Finite Types}
\label{sec:ufin}

In order to defiine the semantics, we seek a mathematical structure satisfying the following properties: (i) it contains structures corresponding to all the finite types and nothing but the finite types, and (ii) it is robust enough to ensure that equivalent encodings of finite types are identified. \note{Is this the correct informal explanation of Ufin?}
