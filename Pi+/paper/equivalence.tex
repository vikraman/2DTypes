\section{Equivalence between \texorpdfstring{$\PiPlusLang$}{Pi} and \texorpdfstring{$\UFin$}{UFin}}~\label{sec:equivalence}

First, we normalise $\PiPlusLang$ to $\PiHatLang$, and show that they are equivalent.

Then we establish the completeness of $\PiHatLang$ with respect to $\UFin$.

We use this to establish completeness for $\PiPlusLang$.

Finally, we show how to translate $\PiLang$ programs to $\PiPlusLang$ programs.
