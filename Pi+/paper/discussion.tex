Our work lies at the intersection of programming language theory, category theory, group theory, rewriting theory, and
formalised mathematics. We review related work in the literature for each topic.

\paragraph{Algebraic Theories} In universal algebra, algebraic theories are used to describe algebraic structures, such
as groups or rings. A specific group or ring is a model of the appropriate algebraic theory. Algebraic theories are
usually \emph{presented} in terms of logical syntax, that is, as first-order theories whose signatures allow only
functional symbols, and whose axioms are universally quantified equations. In his seminal
thesis~\cite{lawvereFUNCTORIALSEMANTICSALGEBRAIC1963}, Lawvere defined a presentation-free categorical notion of
universal algebraic structure, called a Lawvere theory.

Programming Languages, such as the $\lambda$-calculus, can be viewed as algebraic structures with variable-binding
operators, which can be formalised using second-order algebraic theories~\cite{fioreSecondOrderAlgebraicTheories2010},
or algebraic theories with closed structure~\cite{hylandClassicalLambdaCalculus2017}, called $\lambda$-theories, making
the $\lambda$-calculus the presentation of the initial $\lambda$-theory $\Lambda$.

Our family of reversible languages have been presented as first-order algebraic
2-theories~\cite{cohenCoherenceRewriting2theories2009,bekeCategorificationTermRewriting2011,yanofskySyntaxCoherence2000},
which are a categorification of algebraic theories. The types $\zerot$ and $\onet$ are nullary function symbols, the
type formers $+$ and $\times$ are binary function symbols, the 1-combinators are invertible reduction rules, and the
2-combinators are equations or coherence diagrams of compositions of reduction rules. Just like models of Lawvere
theories are given by algebras of (finitary) monads on $\SetCat$, models of 2-theories are given by algebras of 2-monads
on $\CatCat$. The particular one we're interested in here is the free symmetric monoidal completion 2-monad.

\paragraph{Free Symmetric Monoidal Category} The forgetful functor from $\SymMonCat$, the 2-category of (small)
symmetric monoidal categories, strong symmetric monoidal functors, and symmetric monoidal natural transformations, to
the 2-category $\CatCat$, has a left adjoint giving the free symmetric monoidal category $\FSM[\CCat{C}]$ on a category
$\CCat{C}$. This is a 2-monad on $\CatCat$~\cite{blackwellTwodimensionalMonadTheory1989}, and its construction is known
in the literature~\cite{abramskyAbstractScalarsLoops2005}. Concretely, the objects of $\FSM[\CCat{C}]$ are given by
lists of objects of $\CCat{C}$, that is, a pair $(n:\Nat, A:[n] \to \CCat{C}_{0})$. An morphism between $(n,A)$ and
$(n,B)$ is given by a pair $(\pi,\lambda)$ where $\pi$ is a permutation of $[n]$, and
$\lambda_{i} : A_{i} \to B_{\pi(i)}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. Abstractly, this is given by the Grothendieck construction
$\int F$ of the functor $F : \BFin \to \CatCat$ from the groupoid of finite sets and bijections to $\CatCat$, assigning
each natural number $n$ to the $n$-power $C^{n}$ of $C$, and each permutation on $[n]$ inducing an endofunctor on
$C^{n}$ by action. $\BFin$ is the free symmetric monoidal category (groupoid) on one generator, $\FSM[\unit]$. The free
symmetric monoidal category has been used to study concurrency~\cite{hylandSymmetricMonoidalSketches2004}, petri
nets~\cite{baezCategoriesNets2021}, combinatorial structures~\cite{fioreCartesianClosedBicategory2008}, quantum
mechanics~\cite{abramskyAbstractScalarsLoops2005}, bicategorical models of (differential) linear
logic~\cite{melliesTemplateGamesDifferential2019}. In HoTT, the free symmetric monoidal groupoid $\FSM[A]$ over a
groupoid $A$ can be given by $\dsum{X:\UFin}{A^{X}}$, or it can be presented as an algebraic 2-theory using 1-HITs.
These HITs and the proof of their universal property have been considered
in~\citet*{piceghelloCoherenceSymmetricMonoidal2019,choudhuryFinitemultisetConstructionHoTT2019}.

\paragraph{Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence} In~\citet{curryCurryEssaysCombinatory1980}, Lambek extended the
Curry-Howard correspondence to cartesian-closed categories. In this work, we have established a correspondence between a
fragment of the $\PiLang$ family of languages and symmetric monoidal groupoids.

Alternatively, we can describe them using HITs, prove they have the universal property and hence equivalent.
The full Pi is FSMG 1, and the normalised fragment of Pi is M1.

Pi has other extensions (fractional/negative/recursive types).
What are the free X monoidal structures they're describing?

Using our presentation of $S_{n}$, we can construct the Eilenberg-Maclane space (using a HIT) $K(S_{n},1)$. Then, it
should be true that $\UFin \eqv \sqcup_{n:\Nat} K(S_{n},1)$. This is future work.
