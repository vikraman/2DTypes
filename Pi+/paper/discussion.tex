Algebraic theories, 2-algebraic theories, Syntax of Coherence (Yanofsky)

Higher order rewriting theory in constructive type theory.

Free monoids, free commutative monoids, normalisation of monoids.

Coherence problems in type theory, coherence via Well-Foundedness.

Computational group theory (in HoTT?)

Presentation of the free symmetric monoidal groupoid on one generator, proof of Mac Lane's coherence theorem in HoTT.

Alternatively, we can describe them using HITs, prove they have the universal property and hence equivalent.
The full Pi is FSMG 1, and the normalised fragment of Pi is M1.

Applications of FSMG and history of the coherence theorems.

Other proofs of coherence theorems, Joyal-Street.

Pi has other extensions (fractional/negative/recursive types).
What are the free X monoidal structures they're describing?

Using our presentation of $S_{n}$, we can construct the Eilenberg-Maclane space (using a HIT) $K(S_{n},1)$. Then, it
should be true that $\UFin \eqv \sqcup_{n:\Nat} K(S_{n},1)$. This is future work.

Other applications of symmetric groups.

Actions of symmetric groups, permutation groupoids.
