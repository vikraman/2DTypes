\section{Univalent Subuniverses}~\label{sec:univalent}

In this section, we introduce some basic concepts and notation that we use in Homotopy Type Theory. Then, we define
univalent subuniverses and discuss some specific examples.

\subsection{The Type Theory}~\label{subsec:type-theory}

We work in Homotopy Type Theory, in particular, intensional Martin-L\"{o}f Type Theory, with a univalent universe, and
Higher Inductive Types (HITs) for propositional truncations and set quotients. We recall a few basic facts to
familiarise the reader with the notation we use. For more details about basics of HoTT, we refer the reader to the HoTT
book~\cite{univalentfoundationsprogramHomotopyTypeTheory2013}.

\subsubsection{Identity Types}

In HoTT, the intensional identity type is the type of paths between two terms of the same type. Given two terms $x:A$
and $y:A$, we write $x \id_{A} y$, or simply $x \id y$, for the equality type between them. In book HoTT, the identity
type is generated by reflexivity $\refl_{x}$, and the eliminator for the identity type is given by path induction or the
$J$-rule. The identity type equips each type with the structure of an infinity groupoid, or a homotopy type.

Functions between types are functors between groupoids. Given a function $f : A \to B$, the functorial action is given
by

\[
  \term{ap}_{f} : \dfun{x,y:A}{x \id_{A} y \to f(x) \id_{B} f(y)}
\]

Type families are functions from a type to the universe, that is, an indexed family of groupoids. The $\term{transport}$
operation gives the functorial action of paths in the indexing type, which is defined by path induction. If
$P : A \to \UU$ is a type family, then for a path $x \id_{A} y$, we have

\[
  \transport{P} : \dfun{x,y:A}{x \id_{A} y \to P(x) \to P(y)}
\]

From the topological viewpoint, a type family can also be seen as a fibration. For a type family $P : A \to \UU$ and a
point $x : A$, $P(x)$ gives the fiber over $a$. For a path $p : x \id_{A} y$, $\transport{P}{p}$ gives the path lifting
operation. The total space is given by $\dsum{x:A}{P(x)}$ and the first projection $\pi_1 : \dsum{x:A}{P(x)} \to A$ to
the base space is the fibration. The lifting operation lifts paths in the base space to paths in the total space. If
$p : x \id_{A} y$ is a path in the base space, and $u : P(x)$, we have

\[
  \term{lift}(u,p) : (x , u) \id_{\dsum{x:A}{P(x)}} (y , \tr{p}{u})
\]

where $\tr{p}{u}$ is shorthand for $\transport{P,p}(u)$.

Further, using the groupoid structure of $A$, we can show that transport lifts paths to equivalences, we define

\[
  \tptEqv{P} : \dfun{x,y:A}{x \id_{A} y \to P(x) \eqv P(y)}
\]

\begin{definition}[Univalent Fibration]
  $P$ is a univalent type family (or simply a univalent fibration) if $\tptEqv{P}$ is an equivalence.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Univalence}

Voevodsky's \emph{univalence} principle characterises paths in the universe. It says that equivalent types are equal, or
the following function is an equivalence.

\[
  \ua : A \id_{\UU} B \to A \eqv B
\]

Alternatively, one can say that the identity type family $\term{id} : \UU \to \UU$ is univalent.

\subsubsection{Higher Inductive Types}

\begin{definition}[Propositional Truncation]
  Given a type $A$, the propositional truncation $\Trunc[-1]{A}$, or simply $\Trunc{A}$, is a higher inductive type
  generated by the following constructors,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item an inclusion function $\trunc{\blank} : A \to \Trunc{A}$,
    \item for each $x, y : \Trunc{A}$, a path $\term{trunc}(x,y) : x \id_{\Trunc{A}} y$,
  \end{itemize}
  such that, given any type $B$ with
  \begin{itemize}
    \item a function $g : A \to B$,
    \item for each $x, y : B$, a path $\term{trunc*}(x,y) : x \id_{B} y$,
  \end{itemize}
  there is a unique function $f : \Trunc{A} \to B$ such that,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $f(\trunc{a}) \equiv g(a)$
    \item for each $x, y : \Trunc{A}$, $\ap{f}{\term{trunc}(x,y)} \id_{B} \term{trunc*}(f(x),f(y))$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Set Quotient]
  Given a type $A$ which is an $\hSet$, and a relation $R : A \to A \to \hProp$, the set-quotient $\quot{A}{R}$ is the
  higher inductive type generated by
  \begin{itemize}
    \item an inclusion function $q : A \to \quot{A}{R}$,
    \item for each $x, y : A$ such that $R(x,y)$, a path $q(x) \id_{\quot{A}{R}} q(y)$,
    \item a set truncation, for each $x, y : \quot{A}{R}$ and $r, s : x \id_{\quot{A}{R}} y$, we have $r \id s$,
  \end{itemize}
  with an appropriate induction principle.
\end{definition}

We recall that quotients in HoTT are \emph{effective}, that is, if $R$ is an equivalence relation, we have
$R(x,y) \eqv (q(x) \id_{\quot{A}{R}} q(y))$.

\subsection{Univalent Subuniverses}

\begin{definition}[Universe]
  A universe \`{a} la Tarski is given by the following pieces of data,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item a code $U : \UU$,
    \item a decoding function $\El : U \to \UU$.
  \end{itemize}
  If $\El$ is a univalent fibration, $U$ is a univalent universe.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Subuniverse]
  A subtype is a type family $P : \UU \to \UU$ whose fibers are prop-valued, that is, $\forall x, \isProp{P(x)}$. A
  subuniverse generated by a subtype has $U \defeq \dsum{X:\UU}{P(X)}$ and $\El \defeq \fst$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Univalent Subuniverse]
  Subuniverses generated by subtypes are univalent.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $(U, \El) \defeq (\dsum{X:\UU}{P(X)}, \fst)$ is a subuniverse generated by a subtype $P : \UU \to \UU$. For
  any $X, Y : \UU$ such that $\phi : P(X)$ and $\psi : P(Y)$, we want to show that
  $\tptEqv{\fst} : (X,\phi) \id (Y,\psi) \to X \eqv Y$ is an equivalence. We construct
  $X \eqv Y \to (X,\phi) \id (Y,\psi)$ by $\ua$ and using the fact that $P(\blank)$ is a proposition. That it is an
  inverse follows by calculation using the appropriate computation rules.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[$\BAut$]
  The type of self-equivalences on a type $T$ is defined as $\Aut[T] \defeq T \eqv T$. The subuniverse of types that are
  merely equal to $T$ is given by $\BAut[T] \defeq \Sub{T}$. This turns out to be the delooping of $\Aut[T]$, as
  justified by~\cref{lem:loop-deloop}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  The univalent subuniverse of types merely equal to $\Bool$ is given by the subtype $P(X) \defeq \SubP{X}{\Bool}$. This
  can be used to give the denotational semantics of a 2-bit reversible
  language~\cite{caretteReversibleProgramsUnivalent2018}.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[$\Fin$]
  The type family $\Fin : \Nat \to \UU$ is the type of finite sets indexed by cardinality. It is defined equivalently in
  two different ways,
  \begin{gather*}
    \begin{aligned}
      \Fin[n] & \defeq \dsum{k:\Nat}{k \leq n}
    \end{aligned}
    \begin{aligned}
      & \Fin[0] \defeq \bot \\
      & \Fin[\suc[n]] \defeq \top \sqcup \Fin[n]
    \end{aligned}
  \end{gather*}
  Note that $\Fin[n]$ is a $\hSet$, and we use the definitions interchangeably.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  For any $n : \Nat$, we define the subtype of types merely equal to $\Fin[n]$ as $P(X) \defeq \SubP{X}{\Fin[n]}$. This
  gives the univalent subuniverse $\UFin[n] \defeq \Sub{\Fin[n]}$ of finite types with cardinality equal to $n$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[$\isFin$]
  We say that a type is finite if it is merely equal to $\Fin[n]$ for some $n$.
  \[
    \isFin[X] \defeq \dsum{n:\Nat}{\SubP{X}{\Fin[n]}}
  \]
  Note that the natural number $n$ need not be truncated, as justified below.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  $\isFin$ is a proposition.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose we have $(n,\phi) : \isFin[X]$ and $(m,\psi) : \isFin[X]$, we need to show that $(n,\phi) \id (m,\psi)$. It is
  enough to show that $n \id m$. Since $\Nat$ is a set, this is a proposition, so we can use the induction principle of
  propositional truncation to eliminate to $n \id m$, applying it on $\phi$ and $\psi$ respectively. This gives us the
  equalities $X \id \Fin[n]$ and $X \id \Fin[m]$, which gives us $\Fin[n] \id \Fin[m]$, from which $n \id m$ follows by
  taking the first projection.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  The univalent subuniverse of \emph{all finite types} is given by
  \[
    \UFin \defeq \dsum{X:\UU}{\isFin[X]}.
  \]
  We use this as the denotational semantics to interpret our reversible programming language $\PiPlusLang$.
\end{example}

We characterise the path space of subunivalent universes.

\begin{proposition}
  If $T$ is an $n$-type, $\BAut[T]$ is an $(n+1)$-type.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
  $\UFin$ is a 1-type, that is, a 1-groupoid, or has h-level 3.
\end{proposition}

\begin{lemma}~\label{lem:loop-deloop}
  \[
    \Omega\BAut[T] \eqv \Aut[T]
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}
  For every $n:\Nat$,
  \[
    \Omega\UFin[n] \eqv \Aut[\Fin[n]]
  \]
\end{proposition}
