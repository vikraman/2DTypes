# Notes

## Lehmer codes (0.75pp)
### Define Lehmer codes
Mention factorial number system
### Prove the equivalence Lehmer n ≃ Aut (Fin n)

## Symmetric group (1pp)
### Define Sₙ classically (group of permutations)
Talk about group presentations and computational group theory.
### Coxeter presentation - generators, words and relations
Define it - classically and using a set quotient.
Question: why do we choose this particular presentation?
+ Ties with Lehmer and with Mac Lane proof
+ Simple rules

### Explain how Lehmer codes relate to insertion sort.

## Sn ≃ Lehmer (1pp)
### Word problem in the instance of Sₙ
### Solved by reduction to normal form
Images of Lehmer codes are normal forms
### Coxeter rules are not directed, so we modify them
Describe new rules
### Diamond, strong normalization and Church-Rosser for new rules
The reduction relation has to be prop-valued or we cannot get an effective
quotient. So the homotopical structure guides us towards proving strong
normalisation.
### Equivalence (<- and ->) with normal Coxeter
Alternative approaches:
+ Knuth-Bendix algorithm
+ Lascoux method

### TODO
+ Why do we do the proof like that? (as a sequence of equivalences?)
+ Could we skip Lehmer codes?
+ Could we go directly to sequences of transpositions?
