\section{Introduction}~\label{sec:introduction}

Semantically, obvious that only permutation on empty set is id.

Syntactically, we have 0, 1, +, *  and an infinite number of programs of type 0
<-> 0. How do we prove that they are all equivalent to id?

Obvious induction does not work because after a sequential composition step, the
intermediate type is no longer syntactically 0.

So we add size indices to types. Separate U and UHat. Now the proof is obvious.
