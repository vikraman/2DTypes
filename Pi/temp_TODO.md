(Pi part):

 1. Prove the big-id thing
 2. Port the Equiv2.agda to the same structure of ^, Norm etc.
 3. Prove the group presentation
 4. Have only clearly defined syntax manipulation parts (the parts of the proof between U^ and U) left out
 5. Write about the parts that we have done
 6. Wait for prof. Sabry to fill syntax parts and write about them


FSMG:

 1. Prove equivalence between FSMG.M(A) and UFin(A)
 1.1: M -> UFin (by universal property)
        Prove UFin is symmetric monoidal groupoid
 1.2: UFin -> M (easy)
 1.3: Prove equivalence (hard, using Lehmer?)
 1.4: Group presentation of Sn

 2. Prove universal property of FSMG.M(A) and FSMG(A), hence their equivalence

 Paper:

 1. Paper about a construction of the symmetric group in HoTT/UF (MFCS/TYPES/CSL/CPP)
 2. Paper about completeness of Pi+ (could be written for ICFP/POPL)
 3. Paper about a proof of coherence (which implies 1 and 2) (TYPES/CSL/CPP/LICS)ixr 5â—Ž ^_
