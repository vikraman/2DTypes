# README - Coxeter

This directory contains definitions and proofs pertaining to the Coxeter presentation of Sn.

## Code structure

Listed here in dependency order:
    - `Coxeter.agda` - the definition of Coxeter relation on (List N)
    - `NonParametrized` - the definition of the reduction relation, along with the rewriting system and the proof the diamond property, on (List N)
    - `Parametrized` - above proof adapted to (List (Fin n))
    - `LehmerCoxeterEquiv.agda` - transformations between Lehmer codes and lists with Coxeter relations
    - `Lehmer2CoxeterEquiv.agda` - the same as above, but using alternative definition of Lehmer codes
    - `Sn.agda` - definition of Sn as quotient of (List N) by Coxeter relations
    - `Lehmer2SnEquiv.agda` - proof of equivalelence between Lehmer codes and Sn
    - `Norm.agda` 
        - definition of normalisation function for (List N)
        - proofs of its various properties
        - a proof that it splits into a section-retraction pair
    - `NormEquiv.agda` - a proof that Lehmer codes are equivalent to the image of normalization function
    - `GeneratedGroup.agda`, `GeneratedGroupIso.agda` - proves that Sn is equivalent to the group generated by the Coxeter relation
    - `GeneratedGroupGeneralized.agda`, `GeneratedGroupIsoGeneralized.agda` - proves the generalised version of the
    above construction showing how to lift a group structure on List(A) to a group structure on List(A + A)
