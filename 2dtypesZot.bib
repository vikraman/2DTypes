  abstract = {We study structures which have arisen in recent work by the present author and Bob Coecke on a categorical axiomatics for Quantum Mechanics; in particular, the notion of strongly compact closed category. We explain how these structures support a notion of scalar which allows quantitative aspects of physical theory to be expressed, and how the notion of strong compact closure emerges as a significant refinement of the more classical notion of compact closed category.We then proceed to an extended discussion of free constructions for a sequence of progressively more complex kinds of structured category, culminating in the strongly compact closed case. The simple geometric and combinatorial ideas underlying these constructions are emphasized. We also discuss variations where a prescribed monoid of scalars can be `glued in' to the free construction.},

Our framework is based on a less well-studied notion that we call \$\textbackslash Sigma\$-nets, which allow finer control over whether tokens are treated using the collective or individual token philosophy. We describe three forms of execution semantics in which pre-nets generate strict monoidal categories, \$\textbackslash Sigma\$-nets (including whole-grain Petri nets) generate symmetric strict monoidal categories, and Petri nets generate commutative monoidal categories, all by left adjoint functors. We also construct adjunctions relating these categories of nets to each other, in particular showing that all kinds of net can be embedded in the unifying category of \$\textbackslash Sigma\$-nets, in a way that commutes coherently with their execution semantics.},

An infinity group is simply the loops in a pointed, connected type, where the group structure comes from the structure inherent in the identity types of Martin-L\"of type theory. We investigate ordinary groups from this viewpoint, as well as higher dimensional groups and groups that can be delooped more than once. A major result is the stabilization theorem, which states that if an n-type can be delooped n + 2 times, then it is an infinite loop type. Most of the results have been formalized in the Lean proof assistant.},

  abstract = {Homotopy type theory is a version of Martin-L\"of type theory taking advantage of its homotopical models. In particular, we can use and construct objects of homotopy theory and reason about them using higher inductive types. In this article, we construct the real projective spaces, key players in homotopy theory, as certain higher inductive types in homotopy type theory. The classical definition of RPn, as the quotient space identifying antipodal points of the n-sphere, does not translate directly to homotopy type theory. Instead, we define RPn by induction on n simultaneously with its tautological bundle of 2-element sets. As the base case, we take RP-1 to be the empty type. In the inductive step, we take RPn+1 to be the mapping cone of the projection map of the tautological bundle of RPn, and we use its universal property and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on RPn+1. By showing that the total space of the tautological bundle of RPn is the n-sphere Sn, we retrieve the classical description of RPn+1 as RPn with an (n + 1)-disk attached to it. The infinite dimensional real projective space RP{$\infty$}, defined as the sequential colimit of RPn with the canonical inclusion maps, is equivalent to the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z/2Z, 1), which here arises as the subtype of the universe consisting of 2-element types. Indeed, the infinite dimensional projective space classifies the 0-sphere bundles, which one can think of as synthetic line bundles. These constructions in homotopy type theory further illustrate the utility of homotopy type theory, including the interplay of type theoretic and homotopy theoretic ideas.},

  abstract = {Compact closed categories include objects representing higher-order functions and are well-established as models of linear logic, concurrency, and quantum computing. We show that it is possible to construct such compact closed categories for conventional sum and product types by defining a dual to sum types, a negative type, and a dual to product types, a fractional type. Inspired by the categorical semantics, we define a sound operational semantics for negative and fractional types in which a negative type represents a computational effect that ``reverses execution flow'' and a fractional type represents a computational effect that ``garbage collects'' particular values or throws exceptions. Specifically, we extend a first-order reversible language of type isomorphisms with negative and fractional types, specify an operational semantics for each extension, and prove that each extension forms a compact closed category. We furthermore show that both operational semantics can be merged using the standard combination of backtracking and exceptions resulting in a smooth interoperability of negative and fractional types. We illustrate the expressiveness of this combination by writing a reversible SAT solver that uses backtracking search along freshly allocated and de-allocated locations. The operational semantics, most of its meta-theoretic properties, and all examples are formalized in a supplementary Agda package.},

The categorical structures involved are finitary discrete Lawvere 2-theories, though they are approached within the language of term rewriting theory. Two general coherence theorems are obtained. The first applies to terminating and confluent rewriting 2-theories. This result is exploited to construct systematic presentations for the higher Thompson groups and the Higman-Thompson groups. The presentations are categorically interesting as they arise from higher-arity analogues of the Stasheff/Mac Lane coherence axioms, which involve phenomena not present in the classical binary axioms. The second general coherence theorem holds for 2-theories that are not necessarily confluent or terminating and is used to construct a new proof of coherence for iterated monoidal categories, which arise as categorical models of iterated loop spaces and fail to be confluent.},

  abstract = {We address automated testing and interactive proving of properties involving complex data structures with constraints, like the ones studied in enumerative combinatorics, e.g., permutations and maps. In this paper we show testing techniques to check properties of custom data generators for these structures. We focus on random property-based testing and bounded exhaustive testing, to find counterexamples for false conjectures in the Coq proof assistant. For random testing we rely on the existing Coq plugin QuickChick and its toolbox to write random generators. For bounded exhaustive testing, we use logic programming to generate all the data up to a given size. We also propose an extension of QuickChick with bounded exhaustive testing based on generators developed inside Coq, but also on correct-by-construction generators developed with Why3. These tools are applied to an original Coq formalization of the combinatorial structures of permutations and rooted maps, together with some operations on them and properties about them. Recursive generators are defined for each combinatorial family. They are used for debugging properties which are finally proved in Coq. This large case study is also a contribution in enumerative combinatorics.},

  abstract = {Tarski asked whether the arithmetic identities taught in high school are complete for showing all arithmetic equations valid for the natural numbers. The answer to this question for the language of arithmetic expressions using a constant for the number one and the operations of product and exponentiation is affirmative, and the complete equational theory also characterises isomorphism in the typed lambda calculus, where the constant for one and the operations of product and exponentiation respectively correspond to the unit type and the product and arrow type constructors. This paper studies isomorphisms in typed lambda calculiwith empty and sum types from this viewpoint. We close an open problem by establishing that the theory of type isomorphisms in the presence of product, arrow, and sum types (with or without the unit type) is not finitely axiomatisable. Further, we observe that for type theories with arrow, empty and sum types the correspondence between isomorphism and arithmetic equality generally breaks down, but that it still holds in some particular cases including that of type isomorphism with the empty type and equality with zero.},

Second-order universal algebra and second-order equational logic respectively provide a model theory and a formal deductive system for languages with variable binding and parameterised metavariables. This work completes the foundations of the subject from the viewpoint of categorical algebra. Specifically, the paper introduces the notion of second-order algebraic theory and develops its basic theory. Two categorical equivalences are established: at the syntactic level, that of second-order equational presentations and second-order algebraic theories; at the semantic level, that of second-order algebras and second-order functorial models. Our development includes a mathematical definition of syntactic translation between second-order equational presentations. This gives the first formalisation of notions such as encodings and transforms in the context of languages with variable binding.},

Every symmetric monoidal sketch generates a generic model. If the sketch is single-sorted, the generic model can be characterised as a free structure on 1, with structure defined coalgebraically. We investigate how these results generalise results about categories of wirings given by Milner and others, and we outline how the constructs may be extended to model controls and dynamics.},

From the notion of type isomorphisms, we derive a typed, universal, and reversible computational model in which information is treated as a linear resource that can neither be duplicated nor erased. We use this model as a semantic foundation for computation and show that the "gap" between conventional irreversible computation and logically reversible computation can be captured by a type-and-effect system. Our type-and-effect system is structured as an arrow metalanguage that exposes creation and erasure of information as explicit effect operations. Irreversible computations arise from interactions with an implicit information environment, thus making them a derived notion, much like open systems in Physics. We sketch several applications which can benefit from an explicit treatment of information effects, such as quantitative information-flow security and differential privacy.},

  abstract = {An algorithm is described which is capable of solving certain word problems: i.e. of deciding whether or not two words composed of variables and operators can be proved equal as a consequence of a given set of identities satisfied by the operators. Although the general word problem is well known to be unsolvable, this algorithm provides results in many interesting cases. For example in elementary group theory if we are given the binary operator {$\cdot$}, the unary operator -, and the nullary operator e, the algorithm is capable of deducing from the three identities a {$\cdot$} (b {$\cdot$} c) = (a {$\cdot$} b) {$\cdot$} c, a {$\cdot$} a- = e, a {$\cdot$} e = a, the laws a- {$\cdot$} a = e, e {$\cdot$} a = a, a\textendash{} = a, etc.; and furthermore it can show that a {$\cdot$} b = b {$\cdot$} a- is not a consequence of the given axioms. The method is based on a well-ordering of the set of all words, such that each identity can be construed as a ``reduction'', in the sense that the right-hand side of the identity represents a word smaller in the ordering than the left-hand side. A set of reduction identities is said to be ``complete'' when two words are equal as a consequence of the identities if and only if they reduce to the same word by a series of reductions. The method used in this algorithm is essentially to test whether a given set of identities is complete; if it is not complete the algorithm in many cases finds a new consequence of the identities which can be added to the list. The process is repeated until either a complete set is achieved or until an anomalous situation occurs which cannot at present be handled. Results of several computational experiments using the algorithm are given.},

This is as natural and transparent a language for higher category theory as the language of sheaves is for algebraic geometry, or vector spaces for linear algebra. It is introduced carefully, then used to give simple descriptions of a variety of higher categorical structures. In particular, one possible definition of n-category is discussed in detail, and some common aspects of other possible definitions are established. This is the first book on the subject and lays its foundations.

  abstract = {In some substructural logics, the memory used by proofs is treated as a first-class multiplicative resource, but the choices made by those proofs are not. Since we can convert between space and time complexity, these ``resource conscious'' logics are therefore not actually guaranteed to preserve memory\textemdash for example, linear logic allows the erasure and duplication of natural numbers with time complexity proportional to their size. In order to fully account for space-time tradeoffs, we augment contexts to track all information, not just multiplicative resources. This creates a reversible, fully resource-preserving logic which allows us to examine the hidden information effects in linear logic and study reversible computation from a proof-theoretic perspective.},

  abstract = {Using generating functions, MacMahon proved in 1916 the remarkable fact that the major index has the same distribution as the inversion number for multiset permutations, and in 1968 Foata gave a constructive bijection proving MacMahon's result. Since then, many refinements have been derived, consisting of adding new constraints or new statistics. Here we give a new simple constructive bijection between the set of permutations with a given number of inversions and those with a given major index. We introduce a new statistic, mix, related to the Lehmer code, and using our new bijection we show that the bistatistic (mix,INV) is Euler\textendash Mahonian. Finally, we introduce the McMahon code for permutations which is the major-index counterpart of the Lehmer code and show that the two codes are related by a simple relation.},

  abstract = {Proof assistants based on dependent type theory provide expressive languages for both programming and proving within the same system. However, all of the major implementations lack powerful extensionality principles for reasoning about equality, such as function and propositional extensionality. These principles are typically added axiomatically which disrupts the constructive properties of these systems. Cubical type theory provides a solution by giving computational meaning to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, in particular to the univalence axiom and higher inductive types. This paper describes an extension of the dependently typed functional programming language Agda with cubical primitives, making it into a full-blown proof assistant with native support for univalence and a general schema of higher inductive types. These new primitives make function and propositional extensionality as well as quotient types directly definable with computational content. Additionally, thanks also to copatterns, bisimilarity is equivalent to equality for coinductive types. This extends Agda with support for a wide range of extensionality principles, without sacrificing type checking and constructivity.},
