  abstract = {We study structures which have arisen in recent work by the present author and Bob Coecke on a categorical axiomatics for Quantum Mechanics; in particular, the notion of strongly compact closed category. We explain how these structures support a notion of scalar which allows quantitative aspects of physical theory to be expressed, and how the notion of strong compact closure emerges as a significant refinement of the more classical notion of compact closed category.We then proceed to an extended discussion of free constructions for a sequence of progressively more complex kinds of structured category, culminating in the strongly compact closed case. The simple geometric and combinatorial ideas underlying these constructions are emphasized. We also discuss variations where a prescribed monoid of scalars can be `glued in' to the free construction.},

Our framework is based on a less well-studied notion that we call \$\textbackslash Sigma\$-nets, which allow finer control over whether tokens are treated using the collective or individual token philosophy. We describe three forms of execution semantics in which pre-nets generate strict monoidal categories, \$\textbackslash Sigma\$-nets (including whole-grain Petri nets) generate symmetric strict monoidal categories, and Petri nets generate commutative monoidal categories, all by left adjoint functors. We also construct adjunctions relating these categories of nets to each other, in particular showing that all kinds of net can be embedded in the unifying category of \$\textbackslash Sigma\$-nets, in a way that commutes coherently with their execution semantics.},

  abstract = {Ordinal patterns are the common basis of various techniques used in the study of dynamical systems and nonlinear time series analysis. The present article focusses on the computational problem of turning time series into sequences of ordinal patterns. In a first step, a numerical encoding scheme for ordinal patterns is proposed. Utilising the classical Lehmer code, it enumerates ordinal patterns by consecutive non-negative integers, starting from zero. This compact representation considerably simplifies working with ordinal patterns in the digital domain. Subsequently, three algorithms for the efficient extraction of ordinal patterns from time series are discussed, including previously published approaches that can be adapted to the Lehmer code. The respective strengths and weaknesses of those algorithms are discussed, and further substantiated by benchmark results. One of the algorithms stands out in terms of scalability: its run-time increases linearly with both the pattern order and the sequence length, while its memory footprint is practically negligible. These properties enable the study of high-dimensional pattern spaces at low computational cost. In summary, the tools described herein may improve the efficiency of virtually any ordinal pattern-based analysis method, among them quantitative measures like permutation entropy and symbolic transfer entropy, but also techniques like forbidden pattern identification. Moreover, the concepts presented may allow for putting ideas into practice that up to now had been hindered by computational burden. To enable smooth evaluation, a function library written in the C programming language, as well as language bindings and native implementations for various numerical computation environments are provided in the supplements.},

A major result is the stabilization theorem, which states that if an n-type can be delooped n + 2 times, then it is an infinite loop type.

The categorical structures involved are finitary discrete Lawvere 2-theories, though they are approached within the language of term rewriting theory. Two general coherence theorems are obtained. The first applies to terminating and confluent rewriting 2-theories. This result is exploited to construct systematic presentations for the higher Thompson groups and the Higman-Thompson groups. The presentations are categorically interesting as they arise from higher-arity analogues of the Stasheff/Mac Lane coherence axioms, which involve phenomena not present in the classical binary axioms. The second general coherence theorem holds for 2-theories that are not necessarily confluent or terminating and is used to construct a new proof of coherence for iterated monoidal categories, which arise as categorical models of iterated loop spaces and fail to be confluent.},

In this paper we show testing techniques to check properties of custom data generators for these structures. We focus on random property-based testing and bounded exhaustive testing, to find counterexamples for false conjectures in the Coq proof assistant. For random testing we rely on the existing Coq plugin QuickChick and its toolbox to write random generators. For bounded exhaustive testing, we use logic programming to generate all the data up to a given size. We also propose an extension of QuickChick with bounded exhaustive testing based on generators developed inside Coq, but also on correct-by-construction generators developed with Why3. These tools are applied to an original Coq formalization of the combinatorial structures of permutations and rooted maps, together with some operations on them and properties about them. Recursive generators are defined for each combinatorial family. They are used for debugging properties which are finally proved in Coq. This large case study is also a contribution in enumerative combinatorics.},

The answer to this question for the language of arithmetic expressions using a constant for the number one and the operations of product and exponentiation is affirmative, and the complete equational theory also characterises isomorphism in the typed lambda calculus, where the constant for one and the operations of product and exponentiation respectively correspond to the unit type and the product and arrow type constructors. This paper studies isomorphisms in typed lambda calculiwith empty and sum types from this viewpoint. We close an open problem by establishing that the theory of type isomorphisms in the presence of product, arrow, and sum types (with or without the unit type) is not finitely axiomatisable. Further, we observe that for type theories with arrow, empty and sum types the correspondence between isomorphism and arithmetic equality generally breaks down, but that it still holds in some particular cases including that of type isomorphism with the empty type and equality with zero.},

Second-order universal algebra and second-order equational logic respectively provide a model theory and a formal deductive system for languages with variable binding and parameterised metavariables. This work completes the foundations of the subject from the viewpoint of categorical algebra. Specifically, the paper introduces the notion of second-order algebraic theory and develops its basic theory. Two categorical equivalences are established: at the syntactic level, that of second-order equational presentations and second-order algebraic theories; at the semantic level, that of second-order algebras and second-order functorial models. Our development includes a mathematical definition of syntactic translation between second-order equational presentations. This gives the first formalisation of notions such as encodings and transforms in the context of languages with variable binding.},

  abstract = {Computation is a physical process which, like all other physical processes, is fundamentally reversible. From the notion of type isomorphisms, we derive a typed, universal, and reversible computational model in which information is treated as a linear resource that can neither be duplicated nor erased. We use this model as a semantic foundation for computation and show that the "gap" between conventional irreversible computation and logically reversible computation can be captured by a type-and-effect system. Our type-and-effect system is structured as an arrow metalanguage that exposes creation and erasure of information as explicit effect operations. Irreversible computations arise from interactions with an implicit information environment, thus making them a derived notion, much like open systems in Physics. We sketch several applications which can benefit from an explicit treatment of information effects, such as quantitative information-flow security and differential privacy.},

  abstract = {Suppose we are given a graph and want to show a property for all its cycles (closed chains). Induction on the length of cycles does not work since sub-chains of a cycle are not necessarily closed. This paper derives a principle reminiscent of induction for cycles for the case that the graph is given as the symmetric closure of a locally confluent and (co-)wellfounded relation. We show that, assuming the property in question is sufficiently nice, it is enough to prove it for the empty cycle and for cycles given by local confluence.},

  abstract = {Given a type A in homotopy type theory (HoTT), we can define the free {$\infty$}-group on A as the loop space of the suspension of A+1. Equivalently, this free higher group can be defined as a higher inductive type F(A) with constructors unit : F(A), cons : A \textrightarrow{} F(A) \textrightarrow{} F(A), and conditions saying that every cons(a) is an auto-equivalence on F(A). Assuming that A is a set (i.e. satisfies the principle of unique identity proofs), we are interested in the question whether F(A) is a set as well, which is very much related to an open problem in the HoTT book [22, Ex. 8.2]. We show an approximation to the question, namely that the fundamental groups of F(A) are trivial, i.e. that {$\parallel$}F(A){$\parallel$}1 is a set.},

  abstract = {Higher-dimensional category theory is the study of n-categories, operads, braided monoidal categories, and other such exotic structures. It draws its inspiration from areas as diverse as topology, quantum algebra, mathematical physics, logic, and theoretical computer science. The heart of this book is the language of generalized operads. This is as natural and transparent a language for higher category theory as the language of sheaves is for algebraic geometry, or vector spaces for linear algebra. It is introduced carefully, then used to give simple descriptions of a variety of higher categorical structures. In particular, one possible definition of n-category is discussed in detail, and some common aspects of other possible definitions are established. This is the first book on the subject and lays its foundations. It will appeal to both graduate students and established researchers who wish to become acquainted with this modern branch of mathematics.},

We obtain in this way the first game semantics of differential linear logic (DiLL) in its classical form. The construction of the model relies on a careful and healthy comparison with the model of generalised species designed ten years ago by Fiore, Gambino, Hyland and Winskel. Besides the resolution of an old open problem of game semantics, the study reveals an unexpected and promising convergence between linear logic and homotopy theory.},

Since then, many refinements have been derived, consisting of adding new constraints or new statistics. Here we give a new simple constructive bijection between the set of permutations with a given number of inversions and those with a given major index. We introduce a new statistic, mix, related to the Lehmer code, and using our new bijection we show that the bistatistic (mix,INV) is Euler\textendash Mahonian. Finally, we introduce the McMahon code for permutations which is the major-index counterpart of the Lehmer code and show that the two codes are related by a simple relation.},
