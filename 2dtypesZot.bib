We explain how these structures support a notion of scalar which allows quantitative aspects of physical theory to be expressed, and how the notion of strong compact closure emerges as a significant refinement of the more classical notion of compact closed category.We then proceed to an extended discussion of free constructions for a sequence of progressively more complex kinds of structured category, culminating in the strongly compact closed case. The simple geometric and combinatorial ideas underlying these constructions are emphasized. We also discuss variations where a prescribed monoid of scalars can be `glued in' to the free construction.},

  abstract = {Reversibility is a key issue in the interface between computation and physics, and of growing importance as miniaturization progresses towards its physical limits. Most foundational work on reversible computing to date has focussed on simulations of low-level machine models. By contrast, we develop a more structural approach. We show how high-level functional programs can be mapped compositionally (i.e. in a syntax-directed fashion) into a simple kind of automata which are immediately seen to be reversible. The size of the automaton is linear in the size of the functional term. In mathematical terms, we are building a concrete model of functional computation. This construction stems directly from ideas arising in Geometry of Interaction and Linear Logic\textemdash but can be understood without any knowledge of these topics. In fact, it serves as an excellent introduction to them. At the same time, an interesting logical delineation between reversible and irreversible forms of computation emerges from our analysis.},

  abstract = {In their usual form, representation independence metatheorems provide an external guarantee that two implementations of an abstract interface are interchangeable when they are related by an operation-preserving correspondence. If our programming language is dependently-typed, however, we would like to appeal to such invariance results within the language itself, in order to obtain correctness theorems for complex implementations by transferring them from simpler, related implementations. Recent work in proof assistants has shown that Voevodsky's univalence principle allows transferring theorems between isomorphic types, but many instances of representation independence in programming involve non-isomorphic representations. In this paper, we develop techniques for establishing internal relational representation independence results in dependent type theory, by using higher inductive types to simultaneously quotient two related implementation types by a heterogeneous correspondence between them. The correspondence becomes an isomorphism between the quotiented types, thereby allowing us to obtain an equality of implementations by univalence. We illustrate our techniques by considering applications to matrices, queues, and finite multisets. Our results are all formalized in Cubical Agda, a recent extension of Agda which supports univalence and higher inductive types in a computationally well-behaved way.},

  abstract = {Groupoidification is a form of categorification in which vector spaces are replaced by groupoids and linear operators are replaced by spans of groupoids. We introduce this idea with a detailed exposition of `degroupoidification': a systematic process that turns groupoids and spans into vector spaces and linear operators. Then we present three applications of groupoidification. The first is to Feynman diagrams. The Hilbert space for the quantum harmonic oscillator arises naturally from degroupoidifying the groupoid of finite sets and bijections. This allows for a purely combinatorial interpretation of creation and annihilation operators, their commutation relations, field operators, their normal-ordered powers, and finally Feynman diagrams. The second application is to Hecke algebras. We explain how to groupoidify the Hecke algebra associated to a Dynkin diagram whenever the deformation parameter q is a prime power. We illustrate this with the simplest nontrivial example, coming from the A2 Dynkin diagram. In this example we show that the solution of the Yang\textendash Baxter equation built into the A2 Hecke algebra arises naturally from the axioms of projective geometry applied to the projective plane over the finite field Fq. The third application is to Hall algebras. We explain how the standard construction of the Hall algebra from the category of Fq representations of a simply-laced quiver can be seen as an example of degroupoidification. This in turn provides a new way to categorify\textemdash or more precisely, groupoidify\textemdash the positive part of the quantum group associated to the quiver.},

Linear logic conserves accessibility, and hence provides a mechanical metaphor which is more appropriate for a distributed-memory parallel processor in which copying is explicit. However, linear logic's lack of sharing may introduce significant inefficiencies of its own.We show an efficient implementation of linear logic called Linear Lisp that runs within a constant factor of non-linear logic. This Linear Lisp allows RPLACX operations, and manages storage as safely as a non-linear Lisp, but does not need a garbage collector. Since it offers assignments but no sharing, it occupies a twilight zone between functional languages and imperative languages. Our Linear Lisp Machine offers many of the same capabilities as combinator/graph reduction machines, but without their copying and garbage collection problems.}

Traditional reverse abstract interpretation produces relatively poor information due to its inability to guess the previous values of assigned-to variables.We propose an abstract computer model and a programming language\textemdash{$\Psi$}-Lisp\textemdash whose primitive operations are injective and hence reversible, thus allowing arbitrary undoing without the overheads of checkpointing. Such a computer can be built from reversible conservative logic circuits, with the serendipitous advantage of dissipating far less heat than traditional Boolean AND/OR/NOT circuits. Unlike functional languages, which have one ``state'' for all times, {$\Psi$}-Lisp has at all times one ``state'', with unique predecessor and successor states.Compiling into a reversible pseudocode can have benefits even when targeting a traditional computer. Certain optimizations, e.g., update-in-place, and compile-time garbage collection may be more easily performed, because the information may be elicited without the difficult and time-consuming iterative abstract interpretation required for most non-reversible models.In a reversible machine, garbage collection for recycling storage can always be performed by a reversed (sub)computation. While this ``collection is reversed mutation'' insight does not reduce space requirements when used for the computation as a whole, it does save space when used to recycle at finer scales. This insight also provides an explanation for the fundamental importance of the push-down stack both for recognizing palindromes and for managing storage.Reversible computers are related to Prolog, linear logic and chemical abstract machines.},

  abstract = {Ordinal patterns are the common basis of various techniques used in the study of dynamical systems and nonlinear time series analysis. The present article focusses on the computational problem of turning time series into sequences of ordinal patterns. In a first step, a numerical encoding scheme for ordinal patterns is proposed. Utilising the classical Lehmer code, it enumerates ordinal patterns by consecutive non-negative integers, starting from zero. This compact representation considerably simplifies working with ordinal patterns in the digital domain. Subsequently, three algorithms for the efficient extraction of ordinal patterns from time series are discussed, including previously published approaches that can be adapted to the Lehmer code. The respective strengths and weaknesses of those algorithms are discussed, and further substantiated by benchmark results. One of the algorithms stands out in terms of scalability: its run-time increases linearly with both the pattern order and the sequence length, while its memory footprint is practically negligible. These properties enable the study of high-dimensional pattern spaces at low computational cost. In summary, the tools described herein may improve the efficiency of virtually any ordinal pattern-based analysis method, among them quantitative measures like permutation entropy and symbolic transfer entropy, but also techniques like forbidden pattern identification. Moreover, the concepts presented may allow for putting ideas into practice that up to now had been hindered by computational burden. To enable smooth evaluation, a function library written in the C programming language, as well as language bindings and native implementations for various numerical computation environments are provided in the supplements.},

  abstract = {Homotopy type theory is a version of Martin-L\"of type theory taking advantage of its homotopical models. In particular, we can use and construct objects of homotopy theory and reason about them using higher inductive types. In this article, we construct the real projective spaces, key players in homotopy theory, as certain higher inductive types in homotopy type theory. The classical definition of RPn, as the quotient space identifying antipodal points of the n-sphere, does not translate directly to homotopy type theory. Instead, we define RPn by induction on n simultaneously with its tautological bundle of 2-element sets. As the base case, we take RP-1 to be the empty type. In the inductive step, we take RPn+1 to be the mapping cone of the projection map of the tautological bundle of RPn, and we use its universal property and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on RPn+1. By showing that the total space of the tautological bundle of RPn is the n-sphere Sn, we retrieve the classical description of RPn+1 as RPn with an (n + 1)-disk attached to it. The infinite dimensional real projective space RP{$\infty$}, defined as the sequential colimit of RPn with the canonical inclusion maps, is equivalent to the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z/2Z, 1), which here arises as the subtype of the universe consisting of 2-element types. Indeed, the infinite dimensional projective space classifies the 0-sphere bundles, which one can think of as synthetic line bundles. These constructions in homotopy type theory further illustrate the utility of homotopy type theory, including the interplay of type theoretic and homotopy theoretic ideas.},

This perspective conforms to a macro-level view of physics and indeed these operations are realizable using macro-level devices involving thousands of electrons. This point of view is however incompatible with computation realized using quantum devices or analyzed using elementary thermodynamics as both these fundamental physical theories imply that information is a conserved quantity of physical processes and hence of primitive computational operations.},

We show that it is possible to construct such compact closed categories for conventional sum and product types by defining a dual to sum types, a negative type, and a dual to product types, a fractional type. Inspired by the categorical semantics, we define a sound operational semantics for negative and fractional types in which a negative type represents a computational effect that ``reverses execution flow'' and a fractional type represents a computational effect that ``garbage collects'' particular values or throws exceptions. Specifically, we extend a first-order reversible language of type isomorphisms with negative and fractional types, specify an operational semantics for each extension, and prove that each extension forms a compact closed category. We furthermore show that both operational semantics can be merged using the standard combination of backtracking and exceptions resulting in a smooth interoperability of negative and fractional types. We illustrate the expressiveness of this combination by writing a reversible SAT solver that uses backtracking search along freshly allocated and de-allocated locations. The operational semantics, most of its meta-theoretic properties, and all examples are formalized in a supplementary Agda package.},

In this setting, we prove important structural combinatorial properties of singleton multisets arising from concatenations and projections of multisets. This is done in generality, without assuming decidable equality on the carrier set. Further, as applications, we present a constructive formalisation of the relational model of differential linear logic and use it to characterise the equality type of multisets.

The first applies to terminating and confluent rewriting 2-theories. This result is exploited to construct systematic presentations for the higher Thompson groups and the Higman-Thompson groups. The presentations are categorically interesting as they arise from higher-arity analogues of the Stasheff/Mac Lane coherence axioms, which involve phenomena not present in the classical binary axioms. The second general coherence theorem holds for 2-theories that are not necessarily confluent or terminating and is used to construct a new proof of coherence for iterated monoidal categories, which arise as categorical models of iterated loop spaces and fail to be confluent.},

For random testing we rely on the existing Coq plugin QuickChick and its toolbox to write random generators. For bounded exhaustive testing, we use logic programming to generate all the data up to a given size. We also propose an extension of QuickChick with bounded exhaustive testing based on generators developed inside Coq, but also on correct-by-construction generators developed with Why3. These tools are applied to an original Coq formalization of the combinatorial structures of permutations and rooted maps, together with some operations on them and properties about them. Recursive generators are defined for each combinatorial family. They are used for debugging properties which are finally proved in Coq. This large case study is also a contribution in enumerative combinatorics.},

The answer to this question for the language of arithmetic expressions using a constant for the number one and the operations of product and exponentiation is affirmative, and the complete equational theory also characterises isomorphism in the typed lambda calculus, where the constant for one and the operations of product and exponentiation respectively correspond to the unit type and the product and arrow type constructors. This paper studies isomorphisms in typed lambda calculiwith empty and sum types from this viewpoint. We close an open problem by establishing that the theory of type isomorphisms in the presence of product, arrow, and sum types (with or without the unit type) is not finitely axiomatisable. Further, we observe that for type theories with arrow, empty and sum types the correspondence between isomorphism and arithmetic equality generally breaks down, but that it still holds in some particular cases including that of type isomorphism with the empty type and equality with zero.},

  abstract = {Fiore and Hur [10] recently introduced a conservative extension of universal algebra and equational logic from first to second order. Second-order universal algebra and second-order equational logic respectively provide a model theory and a formal deductive system for languages with variable binding and parameterised metavariables. This work completes the foundations of the subject from the viewpoint of categorical algebra. Specifically, the paper introduces the notion of second-order algebraic theory and develops its basic theory. Two categorical equivalences are established: at the syntactic level, that of second-order equational presentations and second-order algebraic theories; at the semantic level, that of second-order algebras and second-order functorial models. Our development includes a mathematical definition of syntactic translation between second-order equational presentations. This gives the first formalisation of notions such as encodings and transforms in the context of languages with variable binding.},

  abstract = {Today's computers are based on irreversible logic devices, which have been known to be fundamentally energy-inefficient for several decades. Recently, alternative reversible logic technologies have improved rapidly, and are now becoming practical. In traditional models of computation, pure reversibility seems to decrease overall computational efficiency; I provide a proof to this effect. However, traditional models ignore important physical constraints on information processing. This thesis gives the first analysis demonstrating that in a realistic model of computation that accounts for thermodynamic issues, as well as other physical constraints, the judicious use of reversible computing can strictly increase asymptotic computational efficiency, as machine sizes increase. I project real benefits for supercomputing at a large (but achievable) scale in the fairly near term. And with proposed future computing technologies, I show that reversibility will benefit computing at all scales. Next, the thesis demonstrates that reversible computing techniques do not make computer design much more difficult. I describe how to design asymptotically efficient processors using an ``adiabatic'' reversible electronic logic technology that can be built with today's microprocessor fabrication processes. I describe a simple universal reversible parallel processor chip that our group recently fabricated, and a reversible instruction set for a more traditional RISC-style uniprocessor. Finally, I describe techniques for programming reversible computers. I present a high-level language and a compiler suitable for coding efficient reversible algorithms, and I describe a variety of example algorithms, including efficient reversible sorting, searching, arithmetic, matrix, and graph algorithms. As an example application, I present a linear-time, constant-space reversible program for simulating the Schr\"odinger wave equation of quantum mechanics.

  abstract = {Conservative logic is a comprehensive model of computation which explicitly reflects a number of fundamental principles of physics, such as the reversibility of the dynamical laws and the conservation of certainadditive quantities (among which energy plays a distinguished role). Because it more closely mirrors physics than traditional models of computation, conservative logic is in a better position to provide indications concerning the realization of high-performance computing systems, i.e., of systems that make very efficient use of the ``computing resources'' actually offered by nature. In particular, conservative logic shows that it is ideally possible to build sequential circuits with zero internal power dissipation. After establishing a general framework, we discuss two specific models of computation. The first uses binary variables and is the conservative-logic counterpart of switching theory; this model proves that universal computing capabilities are compatible with the reversibility and conservation constraints. The second model, which is a refinement of the first, constitutes a substantial breakthrough in establishing a correspondence between computation and physics. In fact, this model is based on elastic collisions of identical ``balls,'' and thus is formally identical with the atomic model that underlies the (classical) kinetic theory of perfect gases. Quite literally, the functional behavior of a general-purpose digital computer can be reproduced by a perfect gas placed in a suitably shaped container and given appropriate initial conditions.},

Third, we show that every symmetric monoidal bicategory is equivalent to a strict one. We give two topological applications of these coherence results. First, we show that the classifying space of a symmetric monoidal bicategory can be equipped with an E{$\infty$} structure. Second, we show that the fundamental 2-groupoid of an En space, n{$\geq$}4, has a symmetric monoidal structure. These calculations also show that the fundamental 2-groupoid of an E3 space has a sylleptic monoidal structure.},

We use this model as a semantic foundation for computation and show that the "gap" between conventional irreversible computation and logically reversible computation can be captured by a type-and-effect system. Our type-and-effect system is structured as an arrow metalanguage that exposes creation and erasure of information as explicit effect operations. Irreversible computations arise from interactions with an implicit information environment, thus making them a derived notion, much like open systems in Physics. We sketch several applications which can benefit from an explicit treatment of information effects, such as quantitative information-flow security and differential privacy.},

Although the general word problem is well known to be unsolvable, this algorithm provides results in many interesting cases. For example in elementary group theory if we are given the binary operator {$\cdot$}, the unary operator -, and the nullary operator e, the algorithm is capable of deducing from the three identities a {$\cdot$} (b {$\cdot$} c) = (a {$\cdot$} b) {$\cdot$} c, a {$\cdot$} a- = e, a {$\cdot$} e = a, the laws a- {$\cdot$} a = e, e {$\cdot$} a = a, a\textendash{} = a, etc.; and furthermore it can show that a {$\cdot$} b = b {$\cdot$} a- is not a consequence of the given axioms. The method is based on a well-ordering of the set of all words, such that each identity can be construed as a ``reduction'', in the sense that the right-hand side of the identity represents a word smaller in the ordering than the left-hand side. A set of reduction identities is said to be ``complete'' when two words are equal as a consequence of the identities if and only if they reduce to the same word by a series of reductions. The method used in this algorithm is essentially to test whether a given set of identities is complete; if it is not complete the algorithm in many cases finds a new consequence of the identities which can be added to the list. The process is repeated until either a complete set is achieved or until an anomalous situation occurs which cannot at present be handled. Results of several computational experiments using the algorithm are given.},

This paper derives a principle reminiscent of induction for cycles for the case that the graph is given as the symmetric closure of a locally confluent and (co-)wellfounded relation. We show that, assuming the property in question is sufficiently nice, it is enough to prove it for the empty cycle and for cycles given by local confluence.},

Equivalently, this free higher group can be defined as a higher inductive type F(A) with constructors unit : F(A), cons : A \textrightarrow{} F(A) \textrightarrow{} F(A), and conditions saying that every cons(a) is an auto-equivalence on F(A). Assuming that A is a set (i.e. satisfies the principle of unique identity proofs), we are interested in the question whether F(A) is a set as well, which is very much related to an open problem in the HoTT book [22, Ex. 8.2]. We show an approximation to the question, namely that the fundamental groups of F(A) are trivial, i.e. that {$\parallel$}F(A){$\parallel$}1 is a set.},

Reversible Boolean circuits and quantum Boolean circuits have been introduced to modelize some physical aspects of computation. Those notions are essential in complexity theory, but we claim that a deep mathematical theory is needed to make progress in this area. For that purpose, the recent developments of knot theory is a major source of inspiration. Following the ideas of Burroni, we consider logical gates as generators for some algebraic structure with two compositions, and we are interested in the relations satisfied by those generators. For that purpose, we introduce canonical forms and rewriting systems. Up to now, we have mainly studied the basic case and the linear case, but we hope that our methods can be used to get presentations by generators and relations for the (reversible) classical case and for the (unitary) quantum case.},

This logical irreversibility is associated with physical irreversibility and requires a minimal heat generation, per machine cycle, typically of the order of kT for each irreversible function. This dissipation serves the purpose of standardizing signals and making them independent of their exact logical history. Two simple, but representative, models of bistable devices are subjected to a more detailed analysis of switching kinetics to yield the relationship between speed and energy dissipation, and to estimate the effects of errors induced by thermal fluctuations.}

The heart of this book is the language of generalized operads. This is as natural and transparent a language for higher category theory as the language of sheaves is for algebraic geometry, or vector spaces for linear algebra. It is introduced carefully, then used to give simple descriptions of a variety of higher categorical structures. In particular, one possible definition of n-category is discussed in detail, and some common aspects of other possible definitions are established. This is the first book on the subject and lays its foundations. It will appeal to both graduate students and established researchers who wish to become acquainted with this modern branch of mathematics.},

In this paper, a transformation based algorithm for the synthesis of such a reversible circuit in terms of n /spl times/ n Toffoli gates is presented. Initially, a circuit is constructed by a single pass through the specification with minimal look-ahead and no back-tracking. Reduction rules are then applied by simple template matching. The method produces very good results for larger problems.},

Therefore, information-preserving computation is essential for constructing computers that use energy more effectively. A more recent motivation to understand reversible transformations also comes from the design of editors where editing actions on a view need to be reflected back to the source data. In this paper we present a point-free functional language, with a relational semantics, in which the programmer is allowed to define injective functions only. Non-injective functions can be transformed into a program returning a history. The language is presented with many examples, and its relationship with Bennett's reversible Turing machine is explained. The language serves as a good model for program construction and reasoning for reversible computers, and hopefully for modelling bi-directional updating in an editor.},

We prove constructively that every even permutation can be implemented without temporary storage using NOT, CNOT, and TOFFOLI gates. We describe an algorithm for the synthesis of optimal circuits and study the reversible functions on three wires, reporting the distribution of circuit sizes. We also study canonical circuit decompositions where gates of the same kind are grouped together. Finally, in an application important to quantum computing, we synthesize oracle circuits for Grover's search algorithm, and show a significant improvement over a previously proposed synthesis algorithm.},

Unfortunately, in proof assistants based on type theory, which are frequently used to mechanize mathematical results and carry out program verification efforts, equality is appallingly syntactic, and as a result, exploiting equivalences is cumbersome at best. Parametricity and univalence are two major concepts that have been explored in the literature to transport programs and proofs across type equivalences, but they fall short of achieving seamless, automatic transport. This work first clarifies the limitations of these two concepts when considered in isolation and then devises a fruitful marriage between both. The resulting concept, called univalent parametricity, is an extension of parametricity strengthened with univalence that fully realizes programming and proving modulo equivalences. Our approach handles both type and term dependency, as well as type-level computation. In addition to the theory of univalent parametricity, we present a lightweight framework implemented in the Coq proof assistant that allows the user to transparently transfer definitions and theorems for a type to an equivalent one, as if they were equal. For instance, this makes it possible to conveniently switch between an easy-to-reason-about representation and a computationally efficient representation as soon as they are proven equivalent. The combination of parametricity and univalence supports transport \`a la carte: basic univalent transport, which stems from a type equivalence, can be complemented with additional proofs of equivalences between functions over these types, in order to be able to transport more programs and proofs, as well as to yield more efficient terms. We illustrate the use of univalent parametricity on several examples, including a recent integration of native integers in Coq. This work paves the way to easier-to-use proof assistants by supporting seamless programming and proving modulo equivalences.},

  abstract = {Using generating functions, MacMahon proved in 1916 the remarkable fact that the major index has the same distribution as the inversion number for multiset permutations, and in 1968 Foata gave a constructive bijection proving MacMahon's result. Since then, many refinements have been derived, consisting of adding new constraints or new statistics. Here we give a new simple constructive bijection between the set of permutations with a given number of inversions and those with a given major index. We introduce a new statistic, mix, related to the Lehmer code, and using our new bijection we show that the bistatistic (mix,INV) is Euler\textendash Mahonian. Finally, we introduce the McMahon code for permutations which is the major-index counterpart of the Lehmer code and show that the two codes are related by a simple relation.},

  abstract = {The classical lambda calculus may be regarded both as a programming language and as a formal algebraic system for reasoning about computation. It provides a computational model equivalent to the Turing machine and continues to be of enormous benefit in the classical theory of computation. We propose that quantum computation, like its classical counterpart, may benefit from a version of the lambda calculus suitable for expressing and reasoning about quantum algorithms. In this paper we develop a quantum lambda calculus as an alternative model of quantum computation, which combines some of the benefits of both the quantum Turing machine and the quantum circuit models. The calculus turns out to be closely related to the linear lambda calculi used in the study of linear logic. We set up a computational model and an equational proof system for this calculus, and we argue that it is equivalent to the quantum Turing machine.},

  abstract = {Proof assistants based on dependent type theory provide expressive languages for both programming and proving within the same system. However, all of the major implementations lack powerful extensionality principles for reasoning about equality, such as function and propositional extensionality. These principles are typically added axiomatically which disrupts the constructive properties of these systems. Cubical type theory provides a solution by giving computational meaning to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, in particular to the univalence axiom and higher inductive types. This paper describes an extension of the dependently typed functional programming language Agda with cubical primitives, making it into a full-blown proof assistant with native support for univalence and a general schema of higher inductive types. These new primitives make function and propositional extensionality as well as quotient types directly definable with computational content. Additionally, thanks also to copatterns, bisimilarity is equivalent to equality for coinductive types. This extends Agda with support for a wide range of extensionality principles, without sacrificing type checking and constructivity.},

The fundamental properties for such languages include backward as well as forward determinism and reversible updates of data. The unique design features of the language include explicit post-condition assertions, direct access to an inverse semantics and the possibility of clean (\{\textbackslash ie\}, garbage-free) computation of injective functions. We suggest the clean simulation of reversible Turing machines as a criterion for computing strength of reversible languages, and demonstrate this for Janus. We show the practicality of the language by implementation of a reversible fast Fourier transform. Our results indicate that the reversible programming paradigm has fundamental properties that are relevant to many different areas of computer science.},

We provide a program inverter for the language and implement a self-interpreter that achieves deterministic forward and backward interpretation of Janus programs without using a computation history. As the self-interpreter is implemented in a reversible language, it is invertible using local program inversion. Many physical phenomena are reversible and we demonstrate the power of Janus by implementing a reversible program for discrete simulation of the Schr\"odinger wave equation that can be inverted as well as run forward and backward.},
