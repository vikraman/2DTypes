There is still some outstanding code that needs done.  To be thorough, 
here is the status of each file in 2D.  With - I indicated things that 
must be done, and with ~, things that would be nice but are not 
critical.  At the end, I distribute the open tasks around

1.  Types - done
2. Power - done
~ could probably be cleaned up, and better names found
3. Iter - done
4. Sing - done
5. ProgMorphisms
- swapSI should be moved to its own file
- Equiv is wrong.
- the equivalences in here should be exactly the same as those in Types
- which means that most of the properties needed here are already proved 
in Types
6. Val
- sym~~ needs to be done (two holes)
~ potential clean-up: some of the arguments to some of the ~~ 
combinators can be made implicit
~ add IsEquivalence and Setoid?
7. Order2Lemmas - done
8. opsem3
- rename to opsem ?
- bwd.fwd~~id needs to be completed
- cong~~ and inverse need to be implemented
- bwd-coherence needs to be implemented
- figure out why Agda things Ap and its inverse are non-terminating.  [Bug?]
9. Frac
- orderC, orderG, 1/orderC, 1/orderG need to be reimplemented in terms 
of things in Val and ProgMorphisms
- oneC, oneG need implemented
10. Order
- do we try to implement order?

and for completeness
11. Equality - obsolete, all this is now in Val
12. Lemmas - not needed?
13. Lemmas2 - not needed?
14. opsem - obsolete
15. opsem2 - obsolete

===

- Finish ProgMorphisms: Jacques
- Finish Val : Vikraman
- Finish opsem3 [bwd.fwd~~id , cong~~ and bwd-coherence]: Vikraman
- Figure out why Ap is not seen to be terminating: Chao-Hong
- finish Frac: Chao-Hong
- implement order: anyone who has time to give it a try!

Please check-in and push often.  If your work depends on other work 
being completed, go ahead and put some (temporary) postulates in place.

If we have time, we might look to prove a further coherence theorem 
between our two semantics.  I'm not sure how to best phrase it, so 
that's why I have not put it in the list.
